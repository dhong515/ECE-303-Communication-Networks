This is the final project for ECE303 Communication Networks in which we worked in a group of 3 to create a VPN web client and server.
The VPN client and server will form an encrypted tunnel that safely protects a userâ€™s network traffic when it travels between the client and server.
The network will make use of 2 Linux-based EC2 instances (one for the server and one for the client) hosted on the AWS cloud.
